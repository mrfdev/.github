## ​ Need Help?

If you're using any of these tools—even just tweaking configs—it's always a good idea to:

- **Backup** your existing setup.
- Drag in only the pieces you need and **test thoroughly** (especially for live servers).
- For CMI‐related questions, feel free to **open an Issue**—I’ll do my best to keep FAQs updated. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
- For plugin forks, refer to the original author’s docs, then experiment with your own setup.
